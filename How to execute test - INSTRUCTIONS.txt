How to execute tests

NOTE : Test case 1 is failing because there are lots of records appearing in the response and I can't delet those 
as there is not fixtureId. 
So we need to delet those 1st in the database and then all will be fine.


Following are the instructions to execute the code::

1. Run following command from command prompt or witin intellij terminal
mvn test -Denvironment=LOCAL

2. Once test run, go to the folder target/cucumber-html-reports/
and open the file overview-features.html

this will show the report.

3. All the logs are saved in APITests.log file inside the root folder.

4. Data like api url's , fixture which needs to be created or deleted are getting fetched from
   config.properties file.
